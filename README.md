# üóÇÔ∏è Portfolio: Research and Projects by Shuhan Chen

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of my academic research and technical projects across different domains, including machine learning, financial analysis, e-commerce data mining, high-performance computing, and more.

## üìä Selected Projects

### 1. [Flood Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/ChenShuhan02/Portfolio)

- **Focus**: Flood Disaster Prediction and Prevention  
- **Technologies**: Pearson Correlation, K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, XGBoost  
- **Overview**:  
  This project uses various **machine learning models** (Pearson correlation analysis, K-means clustering, XGBoost) to predict and prevent flood disasters. It analyzes over a million flood events using features such as infrastructure quality, monsoon intensity, urbanization, and more. Key techniques include clustering flood risk into categories and building predictive models to estimate flood probabilities.
  - **Keywords**: Flood prediction, Correlation analysis, K-means clustering, PCA, XGBoost

### 2. [Innovation-Driven Stock Valuation](https://github.com/ChenShuhan02/Innovation-driven-stock-valuation)

- **Focus**: The Influence Mechanism of R&D Investment in China Stock Market  
- **Technologies**: Empirical Analysis, Stock Valuation Models  
- **Overview**:  
  This research investigates whether **R&D investment** can significantly increase a company's stock valuation, focusing on listed companies in the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchange. Key valuation metrics such as **PB, PE, PCF,** and **TBQ** were used to assess the impact. The findings indicate a positive correlation between technological innovation and stock valuation.
  - **Keywords**: R&D investment, Stock valuation, Empirical analysis, PB, PE ratios

### 3. [Data Analysis and Mining of User Behavior on E-Commerce Platforms](https://github.com/ChenShuhan02/Data-Analysis-and-Mining-of-User-Behavior)

- **Focus**: User Behavior Analysis on E-Commerce Platforms  
- **Technologies**: Clustering, Neural Networks, Statistical Modelling  
- **Overview**:  
  An extensive analysis of user behavior on e-commerce platforms, employing techniques such as **statistical modeling**, **cluster analysis**, and **artificial neural networks**. This research reveals consumer patterns in terms of time and geographic segmentation, enabling better targeted marketing strategies for e-commerce platforms.
  - **Keywords**: Data mining, Clustering, User behavior, E-commerce

### 4. [High Performance Computing: Cache Optimization Strategies](https://github.com/ChenShuhan02/Portfolio)

- **Focus**: Memory Access Patterns and Cache Policy Performance  
- **Technologies**: FIFO, Random Probability Policy (RP), Network Analysis  
- **Overview**:  
  The project evaluates memory access patterns using **Random and FIFO caching policies**. Results show that the Random policy adapts better to scattered memory access patterns. The project also introduces a **Random Probability Policy** for better cache hit rates, and analyzes network topology using NetworkX.
  - **Keywords**: Cache optimization, Memory access, Random Probability Policy, Network analysis

### 5. [Applied Linear Statistical Models for Pollution Analysis](https://github.com/ChenShuhan02/Portfolio)

- **Focus**: Regression Analysis of NH3 Emissions in the Air Pollution Dataset  
- **Technologies**: Ridge Regression, GLS, Data Visualization  
- **Overview**:  
  Conducted a **regression analysis** to predict **NH3 emissions** using a variety of predictor variables such as **NMVOC, BC,** and **CO emissions**. The study addresses issues like multicollinearity and autocorrelation by employing **Ridge Regression** and **Generalized Least Squares (GLS)**, resulting in a robust predictive model for environmental management.
  - **Keywords**: NH3 emissions, Regression analysis, GLS, Multicollinearity

### 6. [League of Legends Tournament Database Design](https://github.com/ChenShuhan02/Portfolio)

- **Focus**: Database Management for E-Sports Tournament  
- **Technologies**: MySQL, Database Normalization  
- **Overview**:  
  Designed a database for managing information related to **League of Legends tournaments**, including teams, players, coaches, matches, and performance. The project applies **normalization** principles for data consistency, flexibility, and efficient querying.
  - **Keywords**: Database design, E-Sports, MySQL, Normalization

## üåü Future Enhancements and Interests
